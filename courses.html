He’s very passionate about teaching and would ask students to discuss with each other during the lecture. The first half of the course is a review of the analog circuit theory. The second half covers the embedded system. We also use the knowledge we’ve built throughout the course to build a sound-following robot with TI’s robotic kit.

They covered the fundamental circuit laws such as KCL and KVL. They also covered theories such as Thevenin equivalent and phasor analysis. Circuit 2 emphasizes frequency domain analysis with Fourier series and bode plot. Those techniques allow us to examine the properties of low, high, and bandpass filters. In the end, we used Laplace Transform to obtain the transient response of the circuit.

                        <td>The series first walked students through the 2’s complement number system and boolean algebra. Then they introduce combinational and sequential circuits such as D-flip flops. In the end, students learned about Moore and Mealy's finite state machines. The Digital System 2 was taught by Professor <a href="https://ece.ucdavis.edu/directory/venkatesh-akella" target="_blank">Akella</a>.</td>

                        <td>The electronic circuit series introduces students to analyze circuits with Bipolar and MOS transistors, which make the circuit an amplifier. The primary goal is to find the gain (output/input) of these amplifiers. Students will learn how to find the amplifier’s gain through large and small signals domain analysis when an AC signal is applied. We explored different amplifier topologies such as the common-emitter, common-base, and diode-connected amplifier. There are also special topologies such as the current mirror and differential pair that copy the current from the input or cancels the common noise from the input. Later in the course, parasitic capacitors would be added to make calculations harder, as they introduce poles in the frequency domain and could degrade the gain at some frequencies. Feedback is also discussed because certain frequencies of a signal may cause positive feedback in the circuit and make the system unstable. I had the excellent opportunity to take EEC110A with Professor <a href="https://ece.ucdavis.edu/directory/hooman-rashtian" target="_blank">Rashtian</a> and EEC110B with Professor <a href="https://ece.ucdavis.edu/directory/omeed-momeni" target="_blank">Momeni</a> You can see my notes <a href="https://github.com/ttwag/EEC110B-Electronic_Circuits" target="_blank">here</a>.</td>

                        <td>Learned about the axioms of probability. Later, we graphed the random variable’s distribution to systematically represent the probability of the event. We learned both the discrete probability mass distribution and continuous density distribution. We calculated the expectation, variance, and moments of the random variable. Toward the end, the course introduces the weak law of large numbers that proves why the sample mean converges to the real mean (expectation) as sample size grows. The central limit theorem shows why the normal distribution is the limiting distribution of sums of random variables.

At the end of the course, we looked at the memory hierarchy of the CPU to see why accessing the cache is faster than using the main memory. This is one of my favorite courses in ECE because I didn’t know why C is compiled into another language and what does it means that the computer reads 0 and 1. I took the class with Professor <a href="https://ece.ucdavis.edu/directory/venkatesh-akella" target="_blank">Akella</a>.

                        <td>This is the senior design series for designing the Internet of Things (IoT) device. EEC175A first introduces the general definition of an IoT device. For example, they can sense, compute, and communicate information to other devices such as a server on the cloud. The course covers analog & digital sensing techniques, digital communication, compression, and internet communication. Professor <a href="https://ece.ucdavis.edu/directory/avesta-sasan" target="_blank">Sasan</a> taught the course. You can view my note <a href="https://github.com/ttwag/EEC175A-IoT_Design" target="_blank">here</a>. In the second half of the course, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/ttwag/P5_Smart_Recycling_System" target="_blank">smart recycling system</a> that uses a robotic arm to sort recyclable items out of the trash on a conveyor belt. I was responsible for setting up a special object detection mechanism that uses Raspberry Pi’s camera to detect a special object specified by the user on a mobile app. It was an unforgettable experience to debug the robotic arm. One time the voltage was incorrect, and we trouble shorted to the ethernet port to find out that the port needed to be replaced. There’s also a time when the solder on the limit switch shorted the entire system 😭. </td>

In the second half, we dived into stochastic processes such as the Markov chain, Weiner Process, and Poisson Process. Here, I realized my math foundation sucks 🤣. I ended up using formulas without knowing what they mean. It motivated me to take other math foundational classes.

He is one of the best professor at Davis for teaching. He makes sure we understand the content and gives context and explanation to different formulas. EEC130A covers the transmission line theory, which explains what happens when the wavelength of the signal is small compared to the size of the circuit. The rest is a review of electricity and magnetism. In EEC130B, we learned about EM wave propagation and the related phenomena such as reflection, transmission, and polarization.
